# Platformer
Searching for people wanting to create a platformer in a team.

I would prefer 16-bit pixel art, but other is also possible.

# SEARCHING FOR ARTISTS, CODERS AND STORYLINE CREATORS.

I wanted to make it in .exe or in a .zip file containing a .exe, but other (as long as it's simple) are also possible.

# Roles:

Coders: 4 places available.
Artists: 2 places available.
Storyline creators/directors: 2 places available.
End-Redaction: Taken by me.
